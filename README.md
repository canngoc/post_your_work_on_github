## Bikeshare Analysis Project Overview

# Overview
    In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate(opens in a new tab), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# Programming Language: Python 3
    In this course, we use Python version 3 (or simply Python 3). If you'd like more details on previous versions of Python and how version 3 differs from previous versions

# System Environment
    Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux
    Prerequisites: Python 3.7 or above 

# Useful Third-Party Packages:
    + IPython(opens in a new tab) - A better interactive Python interpreter
    requests(opens in a new tab) - Provides easy to use methods to make web requests. Useful for accessing web APIs.
    + Flask(opens in a new tab) - a lightweight framework for making web applications and APIs.
    + Django(opens in a new tab) - A more featureful framework for making web applications. Django is particularly good for designing complex, content heavy, web applications.
    + Beautiful Soup(opens in a new tab) - Used to parse HTML and extract information from it. Great for web scraping.
    + pytest(opens in a new tab) - extends Python's builtin assertions and unittest module.
    + PyYAML(opens in a new tab) - For reading and writing YAML(opens in a new tab) files.
    + NumPy(opens in a new tab) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object and useful linear algebra capabilities.
    + pandas(opens in a new tab) - A library containing high-performance, data structures and data analysis tools. In particular, pandas provides dataframes!
    + Matplotlib(opens in a new tab) - a 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments.
    + ggplot(opens in a new tab) - Another 2D plotting library, based on R's ggplot2 library.
    + Pillow(opens in a new tab) - The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
    + pyglet(opens in a new tab) - A cross-platform application framework intended for game development.
    + Pygame(opens in a new tab) - A set of Python modules designed for writing games.
    + pytz(opens in a new tab) - World Timezone Definitions for Python

# File Structure
    + bikeshare.py: Python script encapsulating all code, visualizations, and project reporting.
    + README.md: Detailed documentation outlining project specifics.
